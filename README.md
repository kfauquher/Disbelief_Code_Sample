Mini Resource Cache

My code sample demonstrates a C++ resource cache similar to what might be used in a game engine to manage assets such as textures or sounds. The goal is to show ownership, safe memory management, and prevention of duplicate loads in a byte sized sample.

I ideally had this project load resources, cache resources. give callers ownership, and clean up expired cache entries.

Thank you for taking the time to review this sample. I enjoyed building it and appreciate your consideration!
